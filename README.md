### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Angelina Bushueva, a newbie front-end developer diving deep into React to create cool stuff on the web. I've got a good handle on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and now I'm all about building awesome user interfaces with React.

ðŸš€ Right now, I'm focusing hard on Reactâ€”it's like Lego for making websites! I'm also learning about Redux for managing data and Node.js for the back-end stuff.

ðŸ’¡ When I'm not coding, you can catch me checking out new design ideas and keeping up with what's hot in web development. I love working with others and learning new things, so let's team up and make some web magic!

ðŸŒŸ Drop me a line, and let's build some awesome stuff with React together!
